# Narrative Tree Complexity Metric

I worked with a Psychology research group at the CUNY Grad Center to create a Complexity Metric for research on Interactive Digital Narrative. I used experts in the field to compare pairs of narrative trees, which were then used to create a heirarchy of tree complexities. This expert opinion was then modeled using supervised and unsupervised learning to create a model to assign a Narrative Tree Complexity Metric to new data. I will be a co-author on this paper and continue to work with the group on narrative tree research moving forward.

# Linear Regression Tool

I created a shiny app that allows users to upload their own data set and visually walk through the steps of creating and analyzing multiple and logistic regression.

# Predicting NFL Quarterback Performance with Markov Chains

I created a simulation that predicts the career performance (measured by expected points added) for a quarterback using markov chain transitions.

# Google Gstore Revenue Prediction (Kaggle Competition)

I worked with a team to generate revenue predictions for the Google Gstore. In additon to the modeling, this project highlights my technical writing.
